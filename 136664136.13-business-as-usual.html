<p>A very average week (or two), a few new articles, a few new projects, etc etc.</p><h2>New articles</h2><ul><li><p>Last newsletter I wrote about a list of Jerma fan channels… well, I made it automatically update nightly, and <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/fetching-youtube-metadata-in-github-actions-and-persisting/">wrote a detailed guide</a> (2.7k words!) on <strong>my programming site</strong>.</p></li><li><p>I got in touch with the great guys running miniprojects on Jerma.io, and the channel listing is now at the much catchier URL <a href="https://channels.jerma.io/">channels.jerma.io</a> 🎉 </p></li><li><p>Relatedly, I <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/list-of-yogscast-youtube-channels/">introduced a very similar project</a> for Yogscast official &amp; fan channels. Posting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/comments/165g7b7/i_created_an_adfree_automatically_updating_list/">about it on Reddit</a> got lots of great improvement suggestions!</p></li><li><p>Not strictly an article, but I revamped <a href="https://notes.jakelee.co.uk/lego.html">my “Current LEGO” page</a> to include cute little images of the sets. No real point, but looks nicer than a list!</p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet</h2><ul><li><p>I read an <a href="https://jamesonwilliams.medium.com/why-write-821fe099b587">excellent article by Jameson Williams called </a><em><a href="https://jamesonwilliams.medium.com/why-write-821fe099b587">Why Write?</a></em>. It puts into a words a few ideas I’d been meaning to try and write about eventually (ironically…), whilst adding plenty of convincing points. Whilst it is targeted towards software engineers, it’s applicable to everyone.</p></li><li><p>As with the previous article, t<a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1696602073351979340">his Tweet by Julia Evans</a> is a great summary of how all kinds of great engineers can have positive externalities, whether intentional or not. Personally I think I’m “Bug Chronicler” and “Documentarian”, with all the other types listed being just as important in a team.</p></li><li><p>Old School RuneScape’s Deadman Mode tournament has started again, which means lots of very competitive players! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeHECNrihAzR0fjjtU47ch2DOBSgK9xwt">Solo Mission</a> is probably the easiest to get into, since he actually explains his detailed plans instead of just showing clips.</p></li><li><p>Okay these are deeper cuts of content, but if you’re a Jerma fan you might like the bizarre remix tracks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@japanesecoffeemusic">japanesecoffeemusic</a> makes, like “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9OmYtVYA7c">MONEY</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eohd8lSzpJw">RISK ON</a>”. They are unreasonably good considering they sample dumb clips from streams. 🎶</p></li><li><p>I was reminded of one of my favourite game series of all time, the one that probably got me into Dark Synthwave as a music genre (which I now use as “thinking” music): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg5s5Dq50Rg">Hotline Miami 1</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqr0yUuSiTs">Hotline Miami 2</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE3M4CLhZAM">Team Fortress 2 animation</a> of the 2nd trailer, which is… maybe better than the original?</p></li></ul><h2>Other bits and pieces</h2><ul><li><p>I’ve begun work on an even bigger project that is… not quite ready to share yet. I haven’t forgotten about my fiction writing, too many things to create not enough time! ⏳It should be ready to talk about a bit by next newsletter.</p></li><li><p>I bought 2 LEGO sets at a massive discount (<em><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/bmw-m-1000-rr-42130">BMW M 1000 RR</a></em> for £130 instead of £215, <em><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/ferrari-daytona-sp3-42143">Ferrari Daytona SP3</a></em> for £210 instead of £390(!)), so have spent a lot of time building them! It’s a great opportunity to binge watch TV shows like The Bear or Slow Horses.</p></li><li><p>Cassie has been enjoying the LEGO boxes, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cwe8702t6Tk/">the official LEGO account replied to an image</a> of her happily squishing a box 😸</p></li></ul><p>Have a great week all 🫡</p>
