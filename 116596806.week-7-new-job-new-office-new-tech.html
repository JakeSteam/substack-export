<p>Yes, it is somewhat embarrassing that my “week lee” newsletter hasn’t gone out in 7 weeks. But, you know what 7 is? The number of days in a week! Therefore this is all totally planned and intentional. Maybe.</p><p>Anyway, plenty of new articles, and some life updates.</p><h2>New articles:</h2><ul><li><p>On my <strong>internet history</strong> <strong>site</strong>, I explored the <a href="https://history.jakelee.co.uk/most-annoying-webpage/">Most Annoying Webpage prank from 20 years ago</a> that is inexplicably stuck in my brain.</p></li><li><p>On my <strong>programming site</strong>, I wrote a <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/improving-my-triple-monitor-dual-laptop-standing-desk/">detailed description of my new 3-monitor, 2-laptop workspace</a>, full of novel solutions!</p></li><li><p>On my <strong>personal site</strong>, I summarised my Need for Speed: Unbound experience into a <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/need-for-speed-unbound-tips/">list of tips</a>.</p></li><li><p>Also on my <strong>personal site</strong>, I introduced a new genre of article: DIY! I’m no expert, but my <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/need-for-speed-unbound-tips/">guide to replacing a Flexispot leg motor</a> will likely help a few people.</p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet: </h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-1wcilQ58hI?feature=share&amp;t=2693">Starship’s first test flight</a> with an attached booster finally happened, making it the biggest &amp; most powerful rocket ever launched! It cleared the tower (the primary goal), and passed max-q (danger point) but failed at the stage separation, leading to the usual frustrating “failed launch” headlines from uninformed news outlets. Ah well, looking forward to the next test.</p></li><li><p>I’ve been into Tom Cardy lately, after he turned up on my Spotify and I realised I recognised him from a few YouTube recommendations. Try out the very relatable and catchy “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHIHl8Rw6W8">Big Breakfast</a>”, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrJ6_GAprFE">Hey, I don’t work here</a>”, or “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbmP2c6TGKc">Why am I anxious</a>”.</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/timsoret/status/1644581636846043136">original recording of the Wilhelm scream</a> has been found!</p></li><li><p>Criken’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-E-AYm7PtM">Pokemon Fusion / AI Professor Oak stream highlights</a> were absolutely amazing, and obviously the most productive use of AI yet.</p></li></ul><h2>Other bits and pieces:</h2><ul><li><p>Well, the headline news is that I’ve <strong>signed my contract on a new job</strong>. I’ll avoid mentioning the employer or too many details until I actually start (July), but I’m extremely excited! It’s a small 30ish person startup that I really see the value in, has a very driven and friendly team, along with some truly amazing work/life balance perks. Plus, I’ll be back to hands-on coding, moving from Engineering Manager to Staff Android Engineer! 🎉</p></li><li><p>The furnishing of my new house is getting there, with maybe 80% completed now. Next up, renovating the bathrooms…</p></li><li><p>I’ll talk about it properly when it gets closer to a real thing, but after some domain watching on <a href="https://park.io/">Park.io</a> I managed to grab “<a href="https://rp.lc/">rp.lc</a>”, and am using it for an <a href="https://github.com/JakeSteam/rp.lc">image / world generation project</a> called “Replace”!  </p></li></ul><p>Have a great week everyone 👋</p><p></p>
