<p>Please pretend this is the 1st week of January not the 2nd since that’s a far better time to start a newsletter! A pretty productive writing week, with 3 new posts across 3 different sites, and a mixed collection of intriguing videos from around the internet.</p><h2>New articles:</h2><ul><li><p>On my <strong>programming blog</strong>, I <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/the-runescape-archives-mission-to-rescue-old-runescape-caches/">dived into the RuneScape Archive</a>, a community project to hunt down old cache versions and save them forever.</p></li><li><p>The first ever post on my <strong>internet history blog</strong> was published, an <a href="https://history.jakelee.co.uk/million-dollar-homepage/">exploration of the Million Dollar Homepage</a> exactly 17 years after every pixel was sold. The creator made $1m and eventually founded Calm! </p></li><li><p>I finally unlocked all of Forza’s Horizon Open badges, so wrote <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/complete-guide-to-forza-horizon-5-badges/">a detailed guide to badges / online racing</a> on my <strong>personal blog </strong>for anyone else working their way through the grind.</p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet:</h2><ul><li><p>I love the <strong>Eric Andre show</strong>, every interview has so many hidden bits of madness that rediscovering an old clip gets better with every rewatch. I feel a little sorry for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elpm5zcDEdo">Blake Griffin in his interview</a>, he seems too nice to get Belipe Belipe Belipe’d. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPU4ccgiDS0">Jack McBrayer has an even worse time</a>, poor guy!</p></li><li><p>It’s hard not to love <strong>Group B rallying</strong>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_S9UUHJNaw">this short film featuring Richard Madden (Game of Thrones)</a> beautifully shows the intensity and focus required, whilst also acknowledging that what happens outside the car is just as crucial.</p></li><li><p>Sports can be hard to get into. Luckily, this isn’t the case with <strong>“Car Jitsu”</strong>, which is… wrestling inside a small car. It’s as violent as it is absurd, and the first sport where strangulation by seatbelt is a valid tactic. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH8OhaBucE8">MoistCr1tikal gave a great summary</a>, but every second of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@carjitsuchampionship6540">the CarJitsu Championship channel</a> is amazing.</p></li></ul><h2>Other bits and pieces:</h2><p>I created <a href="https://jakeleeuk.substack.com/">this SubStack</a>, obviously. I’m hoping to use this as an easy way for anyone who inexplicably enjoys my posts to keep track of them despite their tendency to be scattered across various sites. I have no intention of monetising it, but hopefully it’ll be a way to collate all the little things I’m doing online. Not sure when to publish it, Sundays will do for now.</p><p>Internet History also <a href="https://ko-fi.com/internethistory">has a Ko-fi</a>, despite a grand total of… 1 post. This is mostly so anyone can “commission” an article if they really want to, and to get a feel for the platform. The fee structure is very, very generous in comparison to other services, so no risk / cost from my side!</p><p>Finally, it was just over a week ago, but I didn’t know 500 karma bounties even <em>existed</em> on StackOverflow, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/74976792/608312">let alone win one</a>!</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://jakeweeklee.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Jake Week Lee!
