<p>Hello hello, 8 weeks between posts is basically the same as 1 week right? Sure, why not. I was away for a couple of weeks during December, so I at least have a partial excuse!</p><p>Most of these articles are longer form than usual for various reasons, so quality over quantity is another partial excuse. Maybe. </p><h2>New articles</h2><ul><li><p>On my personal site, I wrote four very detailed articles about the cities I visited during my holiday. These take the form of gathering together all the Google Maps reviews, plus an overview of my movements each day: <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/zurich-reviews/">Zurich</a>, <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/vienna-reviews/">Vienna</a>, <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/prague-reviews/">Prague</a>, and <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/berlin-reviews/">Berlin</a>.</p></li><li><p>Also on my personal site, I continued my love for Idle Iktah on Android in the form of a whole bunch of <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/idle-iktah-tips-faqs-and-endgame-guides/">FAQs and advanced guides</a>. Iâ€™m still playing!</p></li><li><p>On my fragments site, I wrote a <a href="https://fragments.jakelee.co.uk/uncertainty-is-fear/">ramble about anxiety</a> whilst I was experiencing a large uncertainty towards the end of last year. Thankfully, itâ€™s resolved positively now.</p></li><li><p>I spent a lot of time in December playing and reviewing games from The Yogscastâ€™s Jingle Jam bundle with 75+ games. I made it through 60 of them, forming <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/reviewing-every-jingle-jam-2023-game/">parts 1 (1-30)</a> and <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/reviewing-every-jingle-jam-2023-game-2/">parts 2 (31-60)</a>, Iâ€™ve still got some left though!</p></li><li><p>Finally, a technical article for a change! I migrated from Lastpass over to 1Password, and <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/1password-migration/">shared some of the positive and negative aspects</a>.</p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet</h2><ul><li><p>Tom Scott, perhaps my favourite educational YouTube over the years, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DKv5H5Frt0">has finally quit</a>. This newsletter itself is just one of many things inspired by him, so I wish him all the best.</p></li><li><p>Obviously anyone with an interest has seen it by now, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdBZY2fkU-0">GTA VIâ€™s first trailer came out</a>. GTA: SA was the first big game I 100%â€™d, so looking forward to it. Hopefully itâ€™s not as online-first as GTA V became.</p></li><li><p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/ShouldHaveCat/status/1738814282312085967">new contender for favourite cat video</a> appeared.</p></li><li><p>One day Iâ€™ll post an update without a RuneScape reference. Today is not that day. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UnpragmaticCovers">UnpragmaticCovers</a> recreates songs using RuneScapeâ€™s soundfont, which presumably means something. Theyâ€™re bizarre to listen to, hereâ€™s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAQN8AD7TUU">blink-182â€™s Dammit</a> and a re-cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nII4rpaBAVA">Gary Julesâ€™ Mad World cover</a>..</p></li></ul><h2>Everything else</h2><ul><li><p>My first Jingle Jam game review article did extraordinarily well! Site-wide traffic was up around 400% for a couple of weeks, with Tuesday 12th December setting all new records. On that day, <code>jakelee.co.uk</code> articles appeared 20,000 times on Google, and were clicked almost 1,000 times. Nice! When this happens, all other articles receive a bit of a boost too.</p></li><li><p>Iâ€™ve been on a very clichÃ© New Yearâ€™s health kick, so of course immediately got a chest infection! Nice one, body.</p></li><li><p>Iâ€™m trying to finish off a couple of almost finished projects, then I might be able to make a start on <strong>the big one</strong>. Weâ€™ll see. Iâ€™ve got a week booked off work later this month, so hopefully have a progress update by the end of it.</p></li></ul><p>Have a good year! ðŸ¥°</p>
