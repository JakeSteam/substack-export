<p>Sure, it’s been a month, but I’ve resigned myself to just publishing these whenever now! At least there’s plenty of articles published.</p><h2>New articles:</h2><ul><li><p>I <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/chase-bank-uk-review/">wrote about my experience using Chase Bank (UK)</a> for the last year on <strong>my personal site</strong>, especially relevant since they’ve just announced joining the Current Account Switch Service.</p></li><li><p>Sticking with the finance theme, I <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/using-income-ratio-spreadsheet-split-bills/">shared the spreadsheet</a> my partner and I use to share household bills fairly despite having different incomes.</p></li><li><p>Also on <strong>my personal site</strong>, I <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/april-may-android-game-reviews/">reviewed 3 Android incremental games</a> I’ve been playing lots of.</p></li><li><p>Amazon no longer supports third party products on their wishlists, so I <a href="https://notes.jakelee.co.uk/wishlist.html">migrated to my own solution</a> after <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/amazon-wishlist-alternatives/">comparing the alternatives</a>.</p></li><li><p>On <strong>my programming site</strong>, I <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/jekyll-github-pages-https/">fixed a small bug</a> around deploying Jekyll sites with a bit of HTTP misconfiguration.</p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet:</h2><ul><li><p>A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-untold-story-of-solarwinds-the-boldest-supply-chain-hack-ever/">long read about the SolarWinds supply chain attack</a>, pretty much a worst case scenario for software developers.</p></li><li><p>I strongly recommend <strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/">Silo</a></strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/"> on Apple TV</a> (although it can’t be Chromecasted, so might have to download elsewhere… 🏴‍☠️). It’s based on “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13453029-wool-omnibus">Wool</a>”, which I read a year ago, however the show absolutely stands up by itself, proven by the 8.2 on IMDb. New episodes every Friday.</p></li></ul><h2>Other bits and pieces:</h2><ul><li><p>I’ve started work on a very, very large Android project, a sequel to my first ever app “Pixel Blacksmith”. There’s a lot to figure out, and I’m using lots of new tech, I’ll undoubtedly write about it properly soon. The game mechanics give me a headache to think about, no idea how I’ll make them understandable to players!</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/12vnjwq/my_professional_wfh_setup_3_monitors_27_1440p_2/">guys on r/battlestations seemed to like my new standing desk setup</a>, I was sure it would be roasted over there!</p></li><li><p>We’ve had lovely weather here, so Cassie has been enjoying the garden lots. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CstcMCOtk-v/">Here’s her lurking in the longish grass</a> (I’ve cut it since then, promise).</p></li><li><p>I’ve been getting into the basics of gardening lately, and really appreciated my local council offering <a href="https://www.surreyep.org.uk/reduce-reuse-recycle/garden-waste/composting/compost-bin-sales/">discounted high quality compost bins for Surrey residents</a>. Great initiative, looking forward to mine eventually turning up.</p></li><li><p>Discord supports markdown, but… not ideally. Numbered lists work under some truly baffling logic, leading simple messages like “47. 48. 49.” to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/13pm93h/numbered_lists_are_very_broken_this_is_47_48_49/">form a jumbled mess</a>. Hmm.</p></li></ul><p>Maybe it’ll be less than a month before the next one of these, maybe not! </p><p>Have a great week 🎉</p>
