<p>For the first time in a while, there are <strong>no</strong> new articles this week! I’ve added <a href="https://github.com/JakeSteam/minimaJake/releases/tag/1.0.4">new functionality to my sites</a>, but none of it really worth writing about.</p><p>Instead, I’ve mostly been busy with non-tech things. Putting togethers tables, chairs, standing desks, plants, rugs, TV units, picking paint colours, getting cat flaps installed, it all takes longer than expected.</p><p>This will be a short post!</p><h2>From elsewhere on the internet:</h2><ul><li><p>The new <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890">Drive to Survive season</a> is out. It’s what got me into Formula 1 a couple of years ago, it’s worth watching even if you have zero interest in F1.</p></li><li><p>I finally watched <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70299275">Whiplash</a>, I’m slowly enjoying J.K. Simmons more and more after seeing him in this and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/detail/0NDVXKXKMZK9QKXT7EKXGPI216/ref=atv_set_wh_dp">Night Sky</a> recently.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLFVD8xaD3U">F1 2023</a> has started! Alonso is very, very fast! Bits are falling off Ferrari’s cars! The first race is today at 3pm, watch it however you can.</p></li></ul><h2>Other bits and pieces:</h2><ul><li><p>I <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/minimaJake/versions/1.0.4">published minimaJake as a “gem”</a>, but can’t actually test it works due to technical issues on my side so… good luck to anyone who wants it!</p></li><li><p>I’m going to start looking into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">NAS</a> soon, my previous solution of streaming from my PC to Chromecast wasn’t reliable, and would be even worse now they’re on different floors. The goal is just a few TB of storage that can be played from any device in the house, primarily a (new) TV.</p></li></ul><p>Have a good week all, hopefully I’ll get some online work done before next Sunday! </p>
