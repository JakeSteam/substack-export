<p>In totally offline news, I finally exchanged contracts on the house I’ve been trying to buy for 4 months &amp; sold my apartment 🎉</p><h2>New articles:</h2><ul><li><p>The main article this week on <strong>my programming blog</strong> is <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/merging-multiple-jekyll-codebases-into-one/">a detailed walkthrough of my mission</a> to merge my 3 blog’s codebases into one, and making all my improvements available for anyone to use. There’s also a ton of other built-in benefits gained from updating the theme, such as automatic dark mode!</p></li><li><p>As part of this merge / migration, I also discovered &amp; <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/adding-new-social-media-link-to-minima/">documented the process for adding new social media links to Minima</a> theme. This is also over on <strong>my programming blog</strong>.</p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet:</h2><ul><li><p>YouTube captions are capable of a LOT more than I thought. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXSCRU-gRy0">This video is.. an experience</a>.</p></li><li><p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.secondleap.rootland">Root Land on Android</a> a fair bit. It’s nothing taxing, just simple “collect resources and unlock new islands”, but it’s great for quick little dopamine hits throughout the day!</p></li><li><p>Forza Horizon 5 published a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48BiCzchcog">“Golden Tank Awards” video</a>, highlighting some of the amazing EventLab creations people have built in the last year. I love Forza’s repeated highlighting of community content from the game, especially as some of it takes so, so long to create.</p></li><li><p>I was feeling nostalgic, so here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do3Rc9f54uQ">“All My Ex’s Live in Texas” in GTA San Andreas</a>, the theme tune to meandering around small back-country towns in a half-broken car on my PS2 back in 2005 or so.</p></li></ul><h2>Other bits and pieces:</h2><ul><li><p>My main news this week is of course my house purchase. Soon my partner and I won’t both be trying to work from home all day in a tiny 1 bed with thin walls &amp; windows, crappy heating, and plenty of outside noise! </p></li><li><p>On a related note, Cassie is very much not a fan of all the boxes full of books, as proven in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CoQZLneMhxo/">this Instagram post</a> from an hour or so before writing this post…</p></li><li><p>On another related note, during the cold weather a while ago Cassie got into the habit of keeping herself warm using my PC’s heat. Unfortunately her sprawled limbs can get in the way a bit, as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CoQZ2trsP7B/">in this Instagram post</a>! </p></li></ul><p>As a warning, next week’s newsletter will likely be super short due to limited internet in my new house. Moving house is always shockingly time consuming, especially with lots of furniture research &amp; shopping to do. 💸</p><p>Have a great week! 👋</p>
