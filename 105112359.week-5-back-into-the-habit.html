<p>As mentioned in week 4 (3 weeks ago…), I finally exchanged on a new house, and have been busy actually moving! I never knew tumble dryers and cutlery had so much complexity…</p><h2>New articles:</h2><ul><li><p>On <strong>my programming blog</strong>, I wrote about how I <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/using-simplejekyllsearch-for-easy-and-quick-site-search/">reduced the load time for search</a> on my sites by 99.5%! </p></li><li><p>After merging all my site codebases as previously mentioned, I made the new theme available for anyone to use as “minimaJake”. Part of this process was <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/introducing-minimajake-for-jekyll/">documenting all the features and changes I’ve made</a> over the years over on <strong>my programming blog</strong>, there’s more than I thought!</p></li><li><p>Since my site codebases are now all merged, I could also easily launch a new site about the site theme itself. Release notes (e.g. <a href="https://minima.jakelee.co.uk/v1.0.3/">v1.0.3 yesterday</a>) and unreleased features are previewed up on <strong><a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/using-simplejekyllsearch-for-easy-and-quick-site-search/">my minimaJake blog</a></strong>.</p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet:</h2><p>There’s quite a lot, one upside of a long break between newsletters!</p><ul><li><p>Formula 1 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNgxMvhb1gc">pre-season testing</a> has finally started, ahead of round 1 on the 3rd March.</p></li><li><p>Interested in paying way too much for a very cool domain like “5.to” ($5k) or “504.io” ($200)? <a href="https://park.io/">Check out Park.io</a>!</p></li><li><p>Atomic Shrimp <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYiP-nqdwaA">released another AI-related video</a>, and I liked his (unfortunately shot down) wild theory about an AI proto-language.</p></li><li><p>Thanks to Spotify’s autoplaylists, I discovered my new favourite artist: AJJ The Band. As nihilistic as they are catchy, the first song I heard is still my favourite: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1601-CSKyL4">Body Terror Song</a>”. Special mentions to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CllfYd4k2RU">Rejoice</a>”, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HutFfYK2L20">Bad Bad Things</a>”, and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP_U0Xl135g">Disposable Everything</a>”.</p></li><li><p>GeoWizard continues to publish his “How Not To Travel USA” series, with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-knvaGS2yI">very car-focused hour</a>.</p></li><li><p>I love Death Grips, but it sure is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgefK2S9cVU">varied listening experience</a>.</p></li><li><p>And finally, Forza Horizon 5’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajFf2RaiZu4">new Rally DLC was announced</a>, with a release date of March 29th. Not quite the theme I was hoping, but new content is always good!</p></li></ul><h2>Other bits and pieces:</h2><ul><li><p>Coffee creamer is amazing! I recently tried it for the first time (we don’t have proper liquid creamer in the UK), and now I’m hooked on importing bottles.</p></li><li><p>Try out the free / cheap Vampire Survivors (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.poncle.vampiresurvivors">Android</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/">Steam</a>) if you like idle games, roguelikes, or bullet hells. It’s a mixture of all 3, and I find myself hopping on for a 5-10m session multiple times during the day.</p></li></ul><p>That’s it! Time to get back to researching inane household items in far too much detail… have a good week.</p>
