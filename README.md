# Substack export

This is just a backup of posts from [my Substack newsletter "Jake Week Lee"](https://jakeweeklee.substack.com/). It probably isn't what you're looking for. 

All exports are manual ([instructions](https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037466012-How-do-I-export-my-posts-), and only include the posts themselves.
