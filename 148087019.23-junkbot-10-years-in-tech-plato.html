<p>Quite a few big articles this month, including one that has been pending publication for 6 months!</p><h2>New articles</h2><ul><li><p>After researching a few historical digital text systems, I <strong><a href="https://plato.jakelee.co.uk/">created an emulator</a></strong> for behaviour from the 1970s’ “PLATO”: overwriting characters to create artwork! There’s also <strong><a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/plato-character-overwrite-emulator/">an explanatory post</a></strong>, but it’s fun to just try various words.</p></li><li><p>This August marks 10 years of being a professional software developer, a startling milestone. It seemed a fitting time to do a <strong><a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/7-lessons-from-a-decade-in-tech/">retrospective on the 7 career lessons</a></strong> I’ve learned from my 7 employers so far. This is also a useful resource the next time someone asks me for general career advice, a question I usually improvise an answer to with mixed results!</p></li><li><p>Perhaps my highest effort article yet, on my Internet History site I published a 4000 word <strong><a href="https://history.jakelee.co.uk/lego-junkbot-technical-and-historical-decompiling/">analysis of LEGO’s “Junkbot” game</a></strong> to mark the 23rd anniversary of it’s release. I spoke to some of the original creators for this article, and it was extremely interesting seeing how many are still making or educating about games today.</p></li><li><p>As is now a monthly tradition, I wrote about the <strong><a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/android-games-august-2024/">3 Android games</a></strong> I’ve been playing in August.</p></li><li><p>I added a tiny new feature to the software my sites run on, adding the ability to add an “Updated” date to an article, released in <strong><a href="https://minima.jakelee.co.uk/v1.0.15/">minimaJake v1.0.15</a></strong>.</p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet</h2><ul><li><p>The twitter account <strong><a href="https://x.com/dailyobject_">@dailyobject_</a></strong> posts a random object every day. Vaguely surreal, always worth keeping an eye on.</p></li><li><p>In San Francisco, automated Waymo cars have a car park they typically congregate in (<strong><a href="https://x.com/abc7newsbayarea/status/1823256993311740196">sometimes noisily</a></strong>). Astonishingly quickly, a 24/7 stream with chill music &amp; a cat cam sprung up creatively titled “<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/h53xlXu_6C4">LoFi Robotaxi Hip Hop Radio 🚕 Waymo Depot Shenanigans To Relax/Study To</a></strong>”. Beautiful.</p></li><li><p>I read a lot, often via my Kindle, and just send them directly instead of using software like Calibre (despite writing <strong><a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/converting-non-amazon-ebooks-and-sending-them-to-your-kindle-using-calibre/">a detailed guide 6 years ago</a></strong>). Recently I encountered a few epub compatibility issues that <strong><a href="https://kindle-epub-fix.netlify.app/">this tiny little webapp</a></strong> solved.</p></li><li><p>If you’re in the UK and also like trying slightly weird snacks, <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/newfoodsuk/">@newfoodsuk</a></strong> on instagram posts new foods daily! Whilst some are probably sponsored posts, it’s a great way to keep an eye out for new stuff. As a recent example, Walkers’ “sausage sarnie with ketchup” crisps are (in my opinion!) a better smoky bacon flavour.</p></li><li><p>There’s <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bovelybebe/">a Korean family on instagram</a></strong> that posts painfully cute videos, reminding me a lot of a young distant family member! For example, <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-pqiiduuZj/">picking who to run to</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-gnP4wtDGz/">sharing food</a></strong>, </p></li></ul><h2>Everything else</h2><ul><li><p>I posted a picture of <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-N0OtqtMtf/">Cassie lying in our garden</a></strong>. She’s very pretty as always. </p></li><li><p>Whilst I’ve been doing some super interesting Android-y stuff on my employer’s app to modernise the codebase recently (<strong><a href="https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-catalogs">version catalogs</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-kotlin-dsl">Kotlin gradle files</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-ksp">KSP</a></strong>, etc), I haven’t written it up yet. Soon! </p></li><li><p>After <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1ezk7v8/obtaining_a_full_list_of_unlocked_achievement/">some help from reddit</a></strong>, I figured out a way to get images of all achievements for my “<strong><a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/reddit-mobile-achievements-guide/">Reddit achievements list</a></strong>” article, and updated the layout etc to be far easier to read.</p></li></ul><p>That’s all! See you in an unknown number of weeks! 🏄‍♂️</p>
