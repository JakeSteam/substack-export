<p>Phew, a bit more of a relaxed newsletter this time due to spending way too much time playing Burnout Paradise, but I managed to publish the usual mix of posts!</p><h2>New articles</h2><ul><li><p>On my <strong>personal site</strong>, I <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/sept-android-game-reviews/">wrote about 4 Android games</a> I had a great time with.</p></li><li><p>Also on my <strong>personal site</strong>, I wrote <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/burnout-paradise-remastered-tips/">47(!) tips for Burnout Paradise</a>, since I spend quite a few hours completing it. The game is a 5 year old remaster of a 15 year old game, but plays better than many recent racing releases.</p></li><li><p>I released an <a href="https://ironmen.jakelee.co.uk/">automatically updating list of 150+ OSRS ironmen</a> YouTube series (and an <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/osrs-ironmen-list-of-youtube-series/">explanatory technical article</a> on my <strong>programming site</strong>), which various subreddits seemed to enjoy (e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UniqueIronmen/comments/17341oa/hello_snowflakes_ive_created_an_adfree_open/">r/uniqueironmen</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ironscape/comments/1734ixb/hello_snowfl_ironmen_ive_created_an_adfree_open/">r/ironscape</a>).</p></li><li><p>After discovering my sites’ table of content can end up being awkward on mobile devices, I released <a href="https://minima.jakelee.co.uk/v1.0.9/">v1.0.9 of my template</a>, with the addition of a collapsible table of contents.</p></li><li><p>On the theme of the new HTML element I used for the collapsible table of contents, I wrote about <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/niche-html-elements/">5 obscure yet powerful built-in HTML elements</a> for my <strong>programming site</strong>. There’s even one for pronunciation hints!</p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet</h2><ul><li><p>I’ve been on a retro Yogscast-y binge lately, such as t<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGOPE-c00p8">his 11 hour(!) highlights</a> from the last 15 years, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYqfXQ-ztmZLJeD1D58QZkHjUv_P4Jus2">Sips’ Fallout 1 series</a> from 8 years ago, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSNIF94te7TxZw-6dKfaXmtA7dl054wAy">Lewis &amp; Ben’s X-Com Files series</a> from 5 years ago. The latter 2 are very chill, very relaxing background videos, love them.</p></li><li><p>Ashens has been around online reviewing crap <em>forever</em>, and I particularly enjoy his videos with Chef(ish) Barry Lewis. Here’s one from a couple of weeks ago <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uxEmF_VTlU">trying to churro-ify various bizarre substances</a> (Pot Noodle! Spam!) with impressive results.</p></li></ul><h2>Other bits and pieces</h2><ul><li><p>I tried out Forza Motorsport on Game Pass for the <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/complete-guide-to-fh5-secret-dlc-cars/#oct-23-chevrolet-corvette-e-ray">free Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray</a> in Forza Horizon 5, and… it wasn’t good. Awful performance, pretty bad graphics, and noticeably stupider AI than I was expecting. It’s a real shame, I would have loved a more “serious” version of Forza Horizon 5 but this just isn’t it. Very glad I didn’t pay any money for it!</p></li><li><p>I’ve been obsessively playing enjoying <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=games.grounded.idleiktah">“Idle Iktah” on Android</a>. Whilst it will of course be included in my next games round-up, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IdleIktah/comments/175out7/a_very_positive_review_of_the_game_after_3_days/">here’s a preview</a> of the overwhelmingly positive review.</p></li></ul><p>Have a good week!</p>
