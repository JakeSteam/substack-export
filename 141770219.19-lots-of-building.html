<p>I’ve been busy learning lots &amp; building a secret side project lately! The experience has reminded me a <strong>lot</strong> of when I first learned Android in my spare time: everything takes 10x as long as expected, but you learn 10x more than expected. The overall effect is positive!</p><p>Anyway, there’s still a few articles and other bits and pieces in the last few weeks.</p><h2>New articles</h2><ul><li><p>Whilst learning the necessary tech for my new project, I experienced decision paralysis after the official tutorials. I managed to get past this with the help of opinionated guidance, so of course <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/decision-paralysis-and-opinionated-guidance/">wrote about the benefits</a> on <strong>my programming site</strong>.</p></li><li><p>On <strong>my personal site</strong>, I <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/forza-horizon-5-comedy-cars/">wrote about the silliest cars</a>, outfits, and liveries I enjoy in Forza Horizon 5, since I’m a massive fan of looking ridiculous in games.</p></li><li><p>Still on <strong>my personal site</strong>, I shared <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/android-game-reviews-feb24/">3 Android games I’ve been into recently</a>. Grimoire Incremental is still holding my attention, but I think I’m approaching the end…</p></li><li><p>On <strong>my misc fragments site</strong>, there’s a <em><a href="https://fragments.jakelee.co.uk/memetic-insight/">fictional</a></em><a href="https://fragments.jakelee.co.uk/memetic-insight/"> paranoid rant</a> about government tracking. It’s a weird one, apologies.</p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Trivia</strong>: This is slightly tech focused, but Google’s “PageRank” is named because it ranks pages, right? MySQL is named because it’s My SQL, right? Nope, they’re named after people like Larry <strong>Page</strong> and <strong>My</strong> Widenius"! Main Street, San Francisco? Named after Charles <strong>Main</strong>, obviously. There’s <a href="https://notes.rolandcrosby.com/posts/unexpectedly-eponymous/">plenty more baffling examples</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>TV: </strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m001tts2/the-space-shuttle-that-fell-to-earth">BBC’s “The Space Shuttle That Fell to Earth”</a> is an excellent miniseries about Columbia’s reentry disaster primarily told through interviews and archive footage. It’s deeply engaging without any unnecessary dramatics, and is by Louis Theroux (not included) &amp; his Mindhouse company.</p></li><li><p><strong>Taskmaster: </strong>I’m a massive fan of Taskmaster, as is most of the UK. However, I somehow missed that there was <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4BZc9sOdNilJJ8irsuOzdg?si=4748585b52434cd3">an official Taskmaster podcast</a> hosted by Ed Gamble, discussing episodes with all of the guests. It’s great being reminded of older seasons, and hearing from old favourites.</p></li><li><p><strong>Audiobooks: </strong>As well as podcasts, I’ve been diving into Spotify’s <a href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/audiobooks/">free 15 hours per month of audiobooks</a>. This is about as much as I listen anyway, and includes 375,000 books so it’s essentially Audible for free! I think this only applies to plan owners, if on a family plan.</p></li><li><p><strong>Internet: </strong>I discovered <a href="https://twitter.com/pronounced_kyle/status/1757215139550605713">some people put on public GitLab Zoom call recordings</a> to pretend they are on work calls to family or friends. A very unexpected use.</p></li><li><p><strong>Music:</strong> Waaaay back <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-134865530">in July 2023 I posted</a> about the musician <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@stdout">$stdout</a>. Now I’m getting closer to the area of tech he works in, so tracks like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx6k6WR8GRs">Hell.js</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yXJ4t6Ax1U">Mess.css</a> suddenly make sense! Ignoring his track about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2GT2PCUN3Q">Side Projects</a> though… 🫣</p></li><li><p><strong>Pokémon:</strong> In a mashup that will appeal to almost every internet-y person my age, here’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwjclyvYNOA">Pokémon Red &amp; Blue theme tune, using the OldSchool Runescape soundfont</a>. Amazing, as are the other uploads such as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f7YyiQx3hI">Smells Like Teen Spirit</a>”, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diTtmOlyjAs">Doom E1M1</a>”, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNRiheDOMFk">“Where is my Mind?”</a>.</p></li></ul><h2>Everything else</h2><ul><li><p>I’ve been doing lots of very fun(!) financial shuffling recently around pensions and investments, so just a general shoutout to <a href="https://ukpersonal.finance/flowchart/">the r/UKPersonalFinance flowchart</a>. It’s essentially guided every financial decision I’ve made in the last 10 years, and shows no signs of stopping. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/">The subreddit</a> is amazing too!</p></li></ul><p>That’s it!
