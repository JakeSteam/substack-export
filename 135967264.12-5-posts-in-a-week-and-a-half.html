<p>Last post I was very proud of making 5 posts in a month, somehow I‚Äôve ended up with 5 posts in a week and a half! Looks like the extra day per week has made a difference already.</p><h2>New articles</h2><ul><li><p>On <strong>my programming site</strong>, I wrote about <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/calculating-jekyll-blog-word-count-and-more/">how to calculate total word count across Jekyll blogs</a>. I‚Äôm up to a somewhat scary 230k words!</p></li><li><p>Also on <strong>my programming site</strong>, I played with <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/github-alert-experiments/">GitHub‚Äôs alert syntax</a>, since a new feature dropped.</p></li><li><p>Tiny update over on <strong>my theme site</strong>, I <a href="https://minima.jakelee.co.uk/v1.0.7/">released v1.0.7</a>. This version added the ability to display word count instead of read time, and some minor CSS improvements.</p></li><li><p>Yet <em>another</em> post on <strong>my programming site</strong>, I played around with Markdown and figured out a <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/markdown-conversation-formatting/">few ways to display conversation transcripts</a>.</p></li><li><p>Finally, I <a href="https://jerma.jakelee.co.uk/">made a list of Jerma fan channels</a>, and <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/jerma-fan-channel-list/">wrote about it on</a>, you guessed it, <strong>my programming site</strong>!</p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/CuriosMuseum/status/1688867837534695426">A very cute ceramic Maya figurine with a removeable helmet</a>. Cute cute cute!</p></li><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/aeqnx/status/1690063254167474176">This month‚Äôs Forza update</a> features 23 new cars(!!!), since Abarth and Alfa licensing has been sorted out again. Love to see new cars in there.</p></li><li><p>Despite arriving very very late to the party, I recently binged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Think_You_Should_Leave_with_Tim_Robinson">I Think You Should Leave</a>. I highly recommend it, it‚Äôs all on Netflix, very short sketch based comedy.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/SimCityLimits">@SimCityLimits</a> is a Twitter (X‚Ä¶) account posting in-universe messages from Sim City 3000, a game I spent SO MANY hours on when I was younger!</p></li><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/pikuma/status/1683130111808118786">‚ÄúMillitext‚Äù is a font</a> where characters are‚Ä¶ 1 pixel wide. It uses subpixels, and is very very cool.  </p></li></ul><h2>Other bits and pieces</h2><ul><li><p>I saw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Portal/comments/15o2498/42_handpicked_portal_wallpapers/jvqrx26/">a post over on r/Portal</a> that sounded weirdly familiar, and realised it was a bot stealing <strong>my</strong> collection of Portal wallpapers from <strong>11 years ago</strong>! In an interesting example of how misconceptions can spread quickly, this led to me <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hardimages/comments/15omcj9/smoking_is_bad_and_all_is_this_hard/jvum2la/">being credited as ‚Äúthe original artist‚Äù</a> of one of the pieces on a popular post.</p></li><li><p>I bought a few new plants for our house, including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvsOe7WNSAX/">one that shared a name with my cat: Cassie</a>! </p></li><li><p>My foray into fiction is slowly progressing, and is up to 3.5k words now (with the story of the next ~10k planned!). I have to be in the right mood for it though, so it tends to be occasional bursts of long writing sessions.</p></li></ul><p>That‚Äôs all for this week(ish), see you soon! üí•</p>
