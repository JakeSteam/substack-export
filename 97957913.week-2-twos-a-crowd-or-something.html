<p>This week I discovered it’s harder than I expected to keep track of interesting bits and pieces I read / watch! Also accidentally made a recursive loop of an article about this newsletter being featured in this newsletter…</p><h2>New articles:</h2><ul><li><p>The big article this week on <strong>my personal blog </strong>was an <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/the-irresistible-allure-of-shitshow-comedy/">analysis and recommendation of my beloved “shitshow comedy” creators</a>, everything from Adam &amp; Joe to Jerma to Eric Andre.</p></li><li><p>Over on <strong>my programming blog</strong>, a quick guide to <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/displaying-complex-content-inside-jekyll-tables/">displaying complex content inside a table on a Jekyll site</a>, since I had some trouble.</p></li><li><p>I also posted an explanation of why I started this newsletter and why I chose Substack in <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/I-made-a-substack-weekly-newsletter/">an announcement post</a> on <strong>my personal blog</strong>.</p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Amazon</strong> is <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.co.uk/news/company-news/amazon-closing-amazonsmile-to-focus-its-philanthropic-giving-to-programmes-with-greater-impact">shutting down it’s Amazon Smile charity initiative</a>.

Yes, it’s basically celebrity gossip, but it provides back story to all the Kim-related music he’s made!</p></li><li><p>One of my favourite long-form gaming historians <strong>Nick930</strong> has released a comprehensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adUoy_pBAz0">history of nearly 40 years of Batman games</a>. </p></li><li><p>Whilst researching an upcoming <strong>internet history</strong> article, I came across Feross Aboukhadijeh’s excellent technical talk about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFZ-pwErSl4">power (and potential for trickery!) on the modern web</a>.</p></li></ul><h2>Other bits and pieces:</h2><p>The sun was setting whilst I walked to the shops a few days ago, so I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CniKG5LsbR7/">took a quick photo for Instagram</a>.</p><p>This newsletter inexplicably gained 10-15 new subscribers in a couple of hours on Thursday, so hello to the new people who saw something they liked!</p><p>That’s it! Hope you have a good week, if you’ve got any feedback / suggestions let me know.</p>
