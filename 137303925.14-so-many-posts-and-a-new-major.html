<p>I made the mistake of waiting 3 weeks between posts, and now I’ve got too much content bunched up! Oops.</p><h2>New articles</h2><p><strong>Programming articles:</strong></p><ul><li><p>I fixed one of the longest running app crashes at work, so <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/displaylistcanvas-crash-with-no-codebase-references/">decided to share the solution</a>. It even involves maths.</p></li><li><p>Outside of work, I <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/removing-github-pages-improve-this-page/">solved the mystery</a> of why a footer only appears on some of my GitHub Pages sites, and how to hide it.</p></li><li><p>Forza Horizon 5 has weekly and monthly updates, but I always get confused by the timezones. Since the team is UK based it only varies by an hour, for others it’s even more confusing! To solve this, I <a href="https://forza.jakelee.co.uk">created a small site</a> that shows the local time for the next update (and <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/forza-update-timer-miniproject/">wrote about it</a>).</p></li><li><p>I’ve used Google Search Console to monitor side projects for a while now, and absolutely love it. No code, configuration, or payment necessary, and it has a ton of unique features, <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/using-google-search-console-for-hobby-projects/">perhaps a sales pitch will help convince others</a>!</p></li></ul><p><strong>Non-programming articles:</strong></p><ul><li><p>In Android Gaming, I <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/august-sept-android-game-reviews/">wrote reviews of 4 games</a> I’ve loved in the past few weeks, a mixture of puzzle, fishing, and logic.</p></li><li><p>With the release of Forza Motorsport later this month, there are now <strong>four</strong> “secret” DLC cars in Forza Horizon 5! As such, I <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/complete-guide-to-fh5-secret-dlc-cars/">shared a guide</a> on where they all come from.</p></li><li><p>I had a play with a free logo generator, and was unexpectedly impressed. As such, I <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/recommendation-shopify-logo-creator/">wrote a review as well as a walkthrough</a> of the full process.</p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet</h2><ul><li><p>At work I <a href="https://gfscott.com/blog/merge-git-repos-and-keep-commit-history/">used this guide</a> to merge a subrepository into our main repo, without losing any history. It’s a simple process once you know how, but the article made it nice and easy to follow even for someone who usually uses a Git GUI (😱).</p></li><li><p><a href="https://free-for.dev/">Free-for.dev</a> is a useful resource that I wish I’d found a few years ago. It’s essentially a giant list of services (e.g. hosting, emails, fonts) that are free for small scale / hobbyist usage. This is great for people like me, who often need tiny free tools for a small project.</p></li><li><p>After seeing him a couple of times in the background of other videos, I’ve finally got into Drew Gooden’s absolutely amazing videos. They’re pretty dry comedy, or mini-documentaries on odd things. A few recommendations are “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8jj0q6RzM">Insane How-To Videos from the 50s</a>” (10:00 is astonishing), and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV2oBnfrXz0">This is Amanda’s Channel Now</a>” with his wife, it even features RuneScape!</p></li><li><p>As someone who is a big fan of weird content (e.g. <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/the-irresistible-allure-of-shitshow-comedy/">my article on “shitshow comedy”</a>), I really enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0kmMJ6F9WM">KVN AUST’s 2 part series</a> about YouTube videos with no views and default titles. It’s well edited, and makes the bizarreness entertaining.</p></li><li><p>I played a LOT of the original LEGO games, before they all became almost identical just with different brands. Luckily, a YouTuber who previously remade Simpsons Hit &amp; Run <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYGjqTFZIvU">is now remaking LEGO Island</a>! Whilst this wasn’t my favourite game, I completed it as a very young child so it’s a very nostalgic series.</p></li><li><p>This is a <a href="https://twitter.com/ChimpDoppio/status/1700995335060173110">very dumb Pokémon video</a>. Sorry.</p></li></ul><h2>Other bits and pieces</h2><ul><li><p>I <a href="https://notes.jakelee.co.uk/identity.html">made a new page on my notes site</a> (it’s a bit pretentious, sorry) trying to pin down the 7 “identities” I have / am working towards. For example yes, I’m an Android Developer. But I’m also a writer. And an open source contributor. Maybe writing down the stages to each identity will help guide me? 🤷‍♂️</p></li><li><p>I’m in the process of starting a new <strong>major</strong> project: A digital cat charity called “<a href="https://codecured.org/">Code Cured The Cat</a>” 🐈. The aim is to use the strength of open source software to improve cat welfare, since the cat charities I currently donate to are typically not very technologically-advanced. This also gives me a great opportunity to try new tech.</p></li><li><p>There’s a lot of paperwork involved in registering a charity, but I’ve made a proof of concept project just to check the domain etc works well. Similar to my past Jerma and Yogscast projects, it’s a (very short for now) <a href="https://youtube.codecured.org/">listing of cat-based YouTube channels</a>!</p></li></ul><p>I regret waiting 3 weeks, this post was far too long! Hopefully see you in 2 weeks 🫡</p>
