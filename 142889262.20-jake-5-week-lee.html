<p>5 weeks, 1 weeks, same thing eh? Ah well, lots of articles!</p><h2>New articles</h2><ul><li><p>I finally escaped Idle Iktah, and <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/android-games-march-2024/">tried out 3 new Android games</a>. A month later, I’m still playing 10-20 minutes of Sorcery School every evening, without any ads / purchases!</p></li><li><p>I spent a <em>lot</em> of time resurrecting a game I played 23 years ago: LEGO Junkbot. Whilst there’s a very long (4k words!) post scheduled for August on my internet history site, there’s a few articles in the interim:</p><ul><li><p>A detailed guide to <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/decompiling-adobe-director-files/">decompiling an Adobe Director file</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/lego-junkbot-files-and-director-tips/">Open sourcing Junkbot, and all the tidying-up I had to do</a>. This included a few “never mentioned online” secrets like developer level names, endearingly informal things like “<em>Shit Stormsof Floaters by Eric (exciting!!! )</em>”.</p></li><li><p>I looked into <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/adding-github-language-with-linguist/">how programming languages work on GitHub</a>, and raised a PR to add the language LEGO Junkbot is written in: Lingo. </p></li></ul></li><li><p>On my GitHub profile, I have my LinkedIn linked. It has a custom icon, and I became curious which other services were supported, and how the detection worked. So, as usual, <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/github-profile-supported-social-links/">I dived super deep and now know far too much</a>! </p></li><li><p>Also released 3 small updates to the site theme I maintain (<a href="https://minima.jakelee.co.uk/v1.0.11/">1.0.11</a>, <a href="https://minima.jakelee.co.uk/v1.0.12/">1.0.12</a>, <a href="https://minima.jakelee.co.uk/v1.0.13/">1.0.13</a>). Nothing crazy, just minor new features, supporting alternative ways of deploying on GitHub, etc. </p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Birds</strong>: Got lost in the “birds mimicking things” rabbit hole again. Here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwxvjrbEkTg">Lyrebird</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CywLrZYOPU8/">here’s “Apollo”</a> who is being taught like a child to identify objects, colours, materials. Very unsettling!  </p></li><li><p><strong>Cat drawings</strong>: “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/drewanimal/">drewanimals</a>”… drew animals. Simple drawings of cat gifs, he does an excellent job capturing the essence of cats.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fish with a credit card</strong>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkh2u0SRWdQ">Amazing footage of a streamer</a> who was using their fishes position in a tank to control a game. The game crashed, but the inputs were still being sent, so the fish ended up navigating to the store and showing their card details. Oops.</p></li><li><p><strong>Event investigations</strong>: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mQ60wNgKrQ">Forensic Architecture</a>” conducts extremely in-depth analyses of events, using all possible data. They remind me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingcat">Bellingcat</a>, and have provided amazing videos full of richly detailed visualisations on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mQ60wNgKrQ">The Beirut Port Explosion</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_xzmOpGypY">Mark Duggan’s Shooting</a>, and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>TV recommendation</strong>: I finished a book I must have downloaded years ago, “The Terror”, and whilst purchasing for my collection discovered it was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2708480/">a highly rated TV show</a> featuring Jared Harris (Chernobyl!). I’ve been really enjoying it, although I prefer <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3974.The_Terror">the book</a> since it can handle the “glimpses of monster” better.</p></li></ul><h2>Everything else</h2><ul><li><p>I enrolled in Coursera Plus to get some Google qualifications only loosely related to my job. First up: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity">Cybersecurity Professional Certificate</a>! I’m <a href="https://github.com/JakeSteam/cybersecurity-certificate-notes">making notes as I go</a>, it’s looking like the “6 month” course will take about 2 weeks. There’s 6 of these qualifications, so my “big project” might be on hold until they’re done.</p></li><li><p>The 2nd year of my 3 year (part-time!) MBA will be finishing next month, next up is a finance related module. Hopefully the easiest yet, since it’s technical?</p></li><li><p>I have a Monstera (cheese plant) that ALWAYS grows faster than I expect, so whenever I buy a bigger pot I’m startled by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C43aiiJtG1N/">the terrifying roots it has grown</a>. At this rate it’ll have a room to itself in a month or two… 🪴</p></li></ul><p>That’s all, see you in… between 1 and 5 weeks! ⏳</p><p></p>
