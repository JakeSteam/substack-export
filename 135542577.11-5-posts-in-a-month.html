<p>Just a short post this time, since I’ve got a few new posts I want to work on! </p><h2>New articles</h2><ul><li><p>On <strong>my personal site</strong> I <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/house-affordability-spreadsheet/">shared my house calculations spreadsheet</a>, which I found super helpful when buying my current house whilst selling old one.</p></li><li><p>After seeing an advert on Instagram, I went to an Amazon virtual guided tour and <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/amazon-virtual-fulfilment-centre-tour/">wrote about the surprisingly interesting experience</a> on <strong>my personal site</strong>.</p></li><li><p>On a quest to discover how many words I’d written in posts, I ended up adding lots of features to a Jekyll utility, as well <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/calculating-jekyll-blog-word-count-and-more/">as a guide on how to use it</a> on <strong>my programming site</strong>. Ended up with 230k words written in total over the last few years!</p></li><li><p>Finally, on <strong>my programming site</strong> I wrote about <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/showing-latest-posts-from-multiple-sources-on-github-profile/">automatically showing latest articles from multiple sources on a GitHub profile</a>. This is how I discovered the pleasant surprise that I’ve published 5 posts in July, all very detailed, unique content. Happy happy:</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f229234-49cf-4524-8589-7822d12ba387_771x167.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f229234-49cf-4524-8589-7822d12ba387_771x167.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f229234-49cf-4524-8589-7822d12ba387_771x167.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f229234-49cf-4524-8589-7822d12ba387_771x167.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f229234-49cf-4524-8589-7822d12ba387_771x167.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4f229234-49cf-4524-8589-7822d12ba387_771x167.png" width="771" height="167" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4f229234-49cf-4524-8589-7822d12ba387_771x167.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:167,&quot;width&quot;:771,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:24079,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f229234-49cf-4524-8589-7822d12ba387_771x167.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f229234-49cf-4524-8589-7822d12ba387_771x167.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f229234-49cf-4524-8589-7822d12ba387_771x167.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f229234-49cf-4524-8589-7822d12ba387_771x167.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>From elsewhere on the internet</h2><ul><li><p>As I’ve undoubtedly mentioned constantly, Jerma has been one of my 2-3 favourite streamers for over a decade by now. I originally got into his content via Team Fortress 2, and he unbelievably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43dVc3PGWZI">did a reunion stream with Ster</a>! So many amazing callbacks, and just a super nostalgic experience overall.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RedPaintSpray/videos">Someone</a> has started creating Jerma AI song covers. They’re all not-quite-convincing (e.g. “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdvEN6IA7jU">Demolition Lovers</a>” or “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF1NY3sQ5jg">You’ve Got a Friend In Me</a>”), but it’s somewhat scary that these can just be pumped out easily even for a streamer without much musical reference material.</p></li><li><p>As I’ve <strong>also</strong> undoubtedly mentioned, I spent an absurd amount of term on RuneScape when I was younger. A GeoGuessr spin-off for RuneScape (well, Old School RuneScape) has been released as “<a href="https://www.osrsguessr.com/">OSRSGuessr</a>”, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zqZKjg3uWI">GeoWizard had a (surprisingly easy!) go</a>.</p></li><li><p>Did you know the letter “G” (and “C”) originally (maybe) came from a pictogram of a camel? Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAKl7bXOGO8">a light-hearted explanation</a>, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimel#Variations">more serious one</a>.</p></li></ul><h2>Other bits and pieces</h2><ul><li><p>On Instagram I posted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvIUZl7tMLg/">Cassie sleeping under a curtain</a>(!), and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvRcwTdNmQ1/">intimidating me from a table</a>. Very typical activities for her.</p></li></ul><p>That’s about it! Have a great week, seeya next week(ish) 🙋‍♂️</p>
