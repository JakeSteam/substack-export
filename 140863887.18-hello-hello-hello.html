I finished <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/idle-iktah-level-3-skiller-tips/">my “no combat” playthrough</a>, so will shortly be seeing how far I can get with “only combat”. </p></li><li><p>Sticking with gaming, I released the <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/reviewing-every-jingle-jam-2023-game-3/">final part of my Jingle Jam review series</a>, unfortunately a couple of a weeks after the bundle stopped being sold! </p></li><li><p>Finally, I did do something technical on my <strong>programming site</strong>!

I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ForzaHorizon/comments/199y6t2/today_is_the_first_day_you_can_use_the_cat_badge/">posted about this over on r/ForzaHorizon</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Nice short post this week (well, 2 weeks, shhh), I’ve got a week off work coming up soon for a side project, maybe there’ll be things to write about there!</p><p>Bye 🙋‍♂️</p>
