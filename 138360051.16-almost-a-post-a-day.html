<p>Quite a busy week, with 7 articles in 8 days. Most of these were written previously however, or are relatively small, but I’m pleased they’re across 5 different sites!</p><h2>New articles</h2><ul><li><p>On my <strong>personal site</strong>, I did <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/warning-signs-of-fake-lego-porsche-911-rsr/">a detailed write-up</a> of a fake LEGO Porsche 911 RSR I accidentally received. Whilst it was extremely high quality, I did find 10 clear indicators that it was fake. This write-up unexpectedly did alright <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7121089108088614912/">on LinkedIn</a> of all places, with ~15 comments &amp; 4k views.</p></li><li><p>Also on my <strong>personal site</strong>, I wrote a <s>love letter to</s> <a href="https://jakelee.co.uk/idle-iktah-android-game/">review of Idle Iktah</a>, an Android game I’ve been playing non-stop the last few weeks. I can’t stop, help.</p></li><li><p>On my <strong>Jekyll theme site</strong>, I <a href="https://minima.jakelee.co.uk/v1.0.10/">shipped v1.0.10</a>. This was a minor update with the ability to disable a couple of features, and support “X” instead of “Twitter”. I’m hoping to release v1.1.0 if I can improve how the theme is distributed.</p></li><li><p>This week I navigated the confusing process of installing <em>LaTeX</em> (primarily used for academia, especially in Science / Tech / Engineering / Maths) on VS Code on Windows. To help others in a similar position, I <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/getting-latex-working-in-vscode-on-windows/">wrote a straightforward guide</a> on my <strong>programming site</strong>. </p></li><li><p>On my <strong>internet history site</strong> I dived into <a href="https://history.jakelee.co.uk/the-scary-maze-game-screamer-decompiled/">the “Scary Maze Game” prank</a> that terrified me as a young child on the internet! The fact I experienced this over half my lifetime ago yet I still remember it indicates what a lasting impact it had on me.</p></li></ul><h2>From elsewhere on the internet</h2><ul><li><p>An extraordinarily well-edited <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY">video around teaching an AI how to play Pokémon</a>. It’s almost unbelievable that this is Peter Whidden’s first and only video, the visualisations, drip-feeding of technical detail, and behind the scenes information at the end is excellent.</p></li><li><p>Whilst this feels a bit like jumping into a TV show on the 3rd season, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck9Pc4aPjRc">Reckless Ben did an exposé of “Mckamey Manor”</a>, a fake haunted house that… tricks people? Gets off on controlling people? It’s an odd video that crosses a few legal lines at times, but an intriguing watch.</p></li><li><p>I’m still on a bit of a Yogscast binge from my last post. Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HmjTvMPCfU">a 42 second clip of Hatfilms clearly not listening to each other</a> whilst playing a game that I deeply enjoy.</p></li><li><p>It’s F1’s Mexican GP this weekend, and they’re using the very pretty Mexican-inspired theme song. Not quite as pretty is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaiRWNPInag">this ridiculous edit</a> giving everyone (except Perez of course) sombreros, moustaches, and new names. Oh dear.</p></li></ul><h2>Other bits and pieces</h2><p>As seems to be becoming a bit of a tradition, I’m kicking off a couple of new projects this newsletter. One is purely commercial, one is purely personal.</p><p><strong>Bounty Hour</strong> is an… overly ambitious startup idea around microcontracting for software development. Think <em>Fiverr</em> meets <em>typical contracting jobs</em> meets <em>bug bounties</em>, with a few unique selling points. I’ll talk about this more when the actual work starts, but suffice to say it’s a service I wish existed, so hopefully others share that opinion! The placeholder site is <a href="https://bountyhour.com">up at BountyHour.com</a>, nothing to see yet.</p><p><strong>Fragments </strong>is a <a href="https://fragments.jakelee.co.uk">collection of small snippets of fiction and non-fiction</a>, to try and make myself more comfortable just <em>writing</em>, without worrying about making a polished, focused, well written article. For now there are two pieces of non-fiction, with plenty more planned: “<a href="https://fragments.jakelee.co.uk/delusions-of-grandeur/">Delusions of grandeur</a>”, accidentally nihilistic thoughts on productivity and legacy. “<a href="https://fragments.jakelee.co.uk/moonshots-and-how-to-achieve-them/">Moonshot</a>”, thoughts on luck and ambition. These are very stream of consciousness with minimal editing, so don’t take any of it too seriously!</p><p>Have a nice week 🥰</p><p></p>
